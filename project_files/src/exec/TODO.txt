TODO
	- loop trough the list of pipes (now it only executes the first command in the list)
	- find last outfile and last infile
	- expand commands with path (add /bin/<command>)
	- finish builtins
	- executed command works only once (/bin/ls works, but if you input it again it will
										not work anymore)
